     The objective of this project is to address the problem of bullying in society.
     Through a combination of HTML, Java Script, and CSS
     When creating a like button for our text boxes, we had to learn Java Script on the spot in order to make sure that it functioned correctly 
     We learned a combination of new Java Script skills in order to make a functioning intereactivve website
     If we had more time to contribute to what we already have, we could work more on the aesthetics of the site with CSS
